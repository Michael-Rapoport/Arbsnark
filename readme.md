# Arbsnark

This project implements an advanced arbitrage trading system on the Ethereum blockchain. It uses smart contracts to execute multi-hop trades across different decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and incorporates flash loans for capital-efficient arbitrage opportunities.

## Features

- Multi-hop arbitrage trades across different DEXs
- Flash loan integration for capital-efficient trading
- Real-time price monitoring using off-chain components
- Advanced profit calculation considering DEX fees and slippage
- Risk management with stop-loss mechanisms and maximum loss limits
- Gas optimization for efficient trade execution
- Automated execution of arbitrage opportunities based on price feeds
- Ability to manually execute arbitrage trades
- Ability to withdraw funds and tokens from the contract
- Secure ownership and access control mechanisms
- Monitoring and maintenance features for updating price feeds and handling vulnerabilities

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Brownie
- Web3.py
- Node.js and npm (for Hardhat, if used)
- An Ethereum wallet with some ETH for deployment and testing

## Deployment

## Usage

1. Start the price monitoring script:
   ```
   python scripts/monitor_prices.py
   ```
   The script will continuously monitor prices and execute arbitrage trades when profitable opportunities are detected.

2. To manually execute arbitrage trades, use the `executeArbitrage` function of the `ArbitrageTrader` contract. You can call this function directly or through a script like the one in `scripts/monitor_prices.py`.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Regularly monitor the price feeds and update them as necessary to ensure accurate price data.
- Keep an eye on potential vulnerabilities in the smart contract code and update the system accordingly.
- Review the system's performance and adjust the risk management parameters (e.g., minimum profit threshold, maximum loss limit) as needed.

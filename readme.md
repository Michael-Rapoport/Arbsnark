# Arbsnark

This project implements an advanced arbitrage trading system on the Ethereum blockchain. It uses smart contracts to execute multi-hop trades across different decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and incorporates flash loans for capital-efficient arbitrage opportunities.

## Features

- Multi-hop arbitrage trades across different DEXs
- Flash loan integration for capital-efficient trading
- Real-time price monitoring using off-chain components
- Advanced profit calculation considering DEX fees and slippage
- Risk management with stop-loss mechanisms and maximum loss limits
- Gas optimization for efficient trade execution

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Brownie
- Web3.py
- Node.js and npm (for Hardhat, if used)
- An Ethereum wallet with some ETH for deployment and testing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/agitronics/Arbsnark.git 

2. Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Install Brownie:
pip install eth-brownie


4. Set up your `.env` file with your private key and Infura project ID:
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id_here


## Configuration

1. Update the `config.json` file with your specific network settings, wallet addresses, and contract addresses.

2. Modify the `scripts/monitor_prices.py` file to connect to your preferred price feed source.

## Deployment

1. Deploy the ArbitrageTrader contract:
brownie run scripts/deploy.py --network mainnet


2. Update the `config.json` file with the deployed contract address.

## Usage

1. Start the price monitoring script:
python scripts/monitor_prices.py


2. The script will continuously monitor prices and execute arbitrage trades when profitable opportunities are detected.

## Testing

Run the test suite using Brownie:
brownie test


## Security Considerations

- Ensure that your private keys are kept secure and never committed to version control.
- Thoroughly audit the smart contract code before deploying to mainnet.
- Implement additional security measures such as multi-sig wallets for managing funds.
- Regularly monitor and update the system to address any potential vulnerabilities.
